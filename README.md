### Skills Test

#### Question 1 to 3

I just re-write the function from K-script to Golang.

#### Question 4

Some people have been studying the following problem: given two numbers, A and B, how many numbers from A to B, inclusive, are divisible by another number K. For example, if A is 1, B is 10, and K is 3, then there are 3 numbers that satisfy this: 3, 6, and 9. Help them by programming a solution to this problem!

Input:

The first line is the number of test cases T. Each test case has three numbers A, B, K, each on their own line given in that order.

Output:

For each test case, output one line of the form “Case C: X” (without the quotes), where C is the case number (starting from 1), and X is the number of integers between A and B, inclusive, that are divisible by K.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ A ≤ B < 10000
1 ≤ K < 10000

Sample Input:

2
1
10
3
8
20
4
Sample Output:

Case 1: 3
Case 2: 4
